## 👁️ a-eye assistant 

literally just a python script that recognizes humans and says hi. it’s giving sentient. 💅

### 🛠️ built with:
* `opencv` for the vision (it sees you)
* `threading` for multitasking 
* `subprocess` so my mac can actually talk

### 🚀 how it works:
1. code sees a face
2. code prints "a human is detected" in the terminal
3. mac says "hii cutie" (as it should).

no thoughts, just code.
